## Professional portfolio site

[Check it out!](https://gness1804.github.io/portfolio-site/index.html)

### Update: I just rebuilt this site with React Router. The site now loads much more quickly and is broken up into easier-to-maintain components. 

This site showcases my web development projects. It contains information on each project and details on my background, including a resume.
